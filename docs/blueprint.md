# **App Name**: La técnica no se olvida
## Core Features:

- Project Intro: A landing page that will describe the goals and scope of the project: the preservation of rural knowledge and technical projects from the students of the CET N°26 of Ingeniero Jacobacci.
- Project Catalog: Organize student technical projects in a clear, filterable manner (by year/topic).  Require users to log in to view the projects.
- Oral History Archive: Present interviews (text, audio, video) with rural families.
- Documentation: Provide instructions on usage, documentation and maintenance for future students and teachers.
- AI-powered Knowledge Base: Enable a user login, then respond to freeform questions based on the project information and documentation. An AI tool should identify whether the available documentation contains an answer to the question, and if so, present it to the user.

## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color will be a muted violet (#A994D9) to represent creativity and wisdom, as this is a project that promotes education. It balances the technical aspect with the ingenuity required to realize each student project.
- Background color: Use a very light blue (#EBF4FA) to create a calming and trustworthy base.
- Accent color: A desaturated green (#98D9A2), lighter than the primary color, that complements the primary while recalling the rural origins of the technical school, as well as the color present on the logo of CET N°26 Ingeniero Jacobacci.
- Use clean, readable sans-serif fonts.
- Icons should be simple and illustrative, reflecting the technical and rural aspects of the content.
- Maintain a clear, structured layout with easy navigation.
